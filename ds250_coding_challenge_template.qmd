```{python}
# Read in libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```


INSIGHT: THERE WERE MANY CHALLENGES IN THIS EXERCISE. i HOPE TO LEARN MORE WITH TIME. 




## Question 2 #:

### Calculate the mean after replacing the missing values with the standard deviation (2 decimal places):
problem = pd.Series([np.nan, 18, 22, 45, 31, np.nan, 85, 38, 129, 8000, 22, 2])Recreate the following image with the flights dataLinks to an external site.


```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Given series with missing values
problem = pd.Series([np.nan, 18, 22, 45, 31, np.nan, 85, 38, 129, 8000, 22, 2])

# Calculate the standard deviation of the non-missing values
std_dev = problem.std()

# Fill the missing values with the calculated standard deviation
problem_filled = problem.fillna(std_dev)

# Calculate the mean of the series after filling the missing values
mean_filled = problem_filled.mean()

# Round the mean to 2 decimal places
mean_filled_rounded = round(mean_filled, 2)

mean_filled_rounded


```
